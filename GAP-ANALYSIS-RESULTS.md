## Gap Analysis: Areas Needing Attention

### Gap 1: ADR Documentation (Score: 2/3)

**Current State:** You make excellent architectural decisions but don't have formal ADR documents in repositories.

**Impact:** Missing proof of decision-making process that senior roles require.

**Action Required:**
- Create 3-5 ADR documents for CompileForge
- Add to GitHub repository
- Reference in portfolio case studies

**ADR Template to Create:**

```markdown
# ADR-001: Signals + NgRx Hybrid State Management

## Status: Accepted (January 2025)

## Context
CompileForge requires complex state management for:
- Real-time grading with 100+ simultaneous instructors
- Optimistic updates with rollback capability
- 10,000+ submissions across multiple views

## Decision
Adopt hybrid approach:
- NgRx for global state (auth, submissions, assessments)
- Signals for local component state (filters, UI state)
- NgRx Effects for side effects and real-time sync

## Alternatives Considered
1. Pure NgRx - Too verbose for local state
2. Pure Signals - Lacks effects pattern for async
3. Observable Store - Less tooling support

## Consequences
- ✅ Optimal performance through selective reactivity
- ✅ Familiar pattern for enterprise Angular teams
- ⚠️ Team must understand both paradigms
- ⚠️ Slightly larger bundle than pure Signals
```

---

### Gap 2: Live Demos (Score: 2/3)

**Current State:** CompileForge has staging access, but enterprise projects (CSG, Cinglevue) cannot be shown.

**Impact:** Cannot visually demonstrate enterprise work.

**Action Required:**
- Create video walkthroughs for NDA-protected projects
- Build demo versions with anonymized/mock data
- Use architecture diagrams as visual proof

**Demo Strategy:**

| Project | Demo Approach |
|---------|---------------|
| CompileForge | Staging environment demo |
| ChainFortress | GitHub repo + architecture diagrams |
| CSG | Video walkthrough + anonymized screenshots |
| Cinglevue | Architecture diagram + metrics |
| eBuilder | Metrics + technical description |

---

### Gap 3: GitHub Repository Quality (Score: 2/3)

**Current State:** Repositories exist but lack:
- Comprehensive READMEs
- CI/CD badges
- Test coverage badges
- Live demo links

**Action Required:**
- Update all portfolio repositories with professional READMEs
- Add GitHub Actions badges
- Add Codecov/coverage badges
- Link to live demos

**README Template:**
